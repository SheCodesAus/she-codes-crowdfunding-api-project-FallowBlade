pledge.project 

project.pledges.all (give you all the pledges = a list of pledges)
for pledge in p.pledges
    print (pledge.amount)

p.pledges.create


TASK: To add (get) all the pledges for one project to see if goal has been reached:

import from django.db.models import sum avg, count, min, sum

p= Project.object.annotate(total=Sum('pledges__amount')).first


THIS PART WORKS!!
p.pledges.aggregate(sum=Sum('amount'))['sum']
